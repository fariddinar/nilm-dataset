## Description

Our dataset provides electrical consumption data collected using synchronized sensor nodes, it also includes high-frequency electircal signatures such as current harmonics. The dataset is designed to support research in **Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)**, focusing on appliance-level transient detection and load disaggregation. The dataset is collected using **ATM90E36A and ESP32 based custom sensor nodes**, each capable of recording synchronized various electrical signatures across multiple electrical phases.

## Key Features

* **Sensors**: 4 nodes with 3 phases each (12 total channels)
* **Data Format**: CSV files with columns : `time`, `irms`, `vrms`, `power_factor`, `p_apparente`, `p_active`, `h1-h32`
* **Appliances**: Hair dryer, Electric water heater, Fridge, Iron, Laptop charger, etc.

## Data structure

The data folder is structured as the following :
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ data                   
      â””â”€â”€ 05-12 8h 
      â”‚       â””â”€â”€S1P1.csv
      â”‚       â”‚    .

## Dataset Contents

All datasets are stored in the `/data/` directory. Each folder (e.g., `05-16 8h/`) contains 12 CSV files named `SxPy.csv`, representing **Sensor x, Phase y**.

## Usage Example

Clone the repository and run the appliance mapping, loading and plotting script:

### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/fariddinar/nilm-dataset.git
```
### Change into the scripts directory
```
cd nilm-dataset/scripts
```

#### Run the appliance mapping script
```
python map_files_to_appliances.py
```

### To load and visualize a specific appliance signal:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("data/05-16 8h/S1P1.csv")
plt.plot(df["time"], df["p_active"])
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Active Power (W)")
plt.title("Hair Dryer")
plt.show()
```
